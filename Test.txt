/// Welcome to the daily challenge with Unity And Coffee!
/// Description: Below we have a method called successMessage(); that prints a debug of success,
/// We need successMessage() to be called when the timer has run out!
// Hint 1: look at deltaTime in the Scripting Reference
// Hint 2: This can be solved with a special static method also instead of deltatime

	private bool m_isDead = false;

	// Use this for initialization
	void Start () {

	// Update is called once per frame
