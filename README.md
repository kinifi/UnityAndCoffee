# UnityAndCoffee

*Description:*

Unity and Coffee is made just to wake up in the morning, start your computer, grab some coffee and learn/stretch your brain a bit. A weekly puzzle to keep you on edge while programming in C#. 

*Setup:*

1. Just Download the UnityAndCoffee.cs script and put it into an empty project.
2. You do not need the .txt file. Delete it

*File Description:*

1. UnityAndCoffee.cs is the only file needed to get the daily challenges. This will be the file we deliver to those that need it. 
2. version.txt is the text file read so we can convert the string to an int/float and check it against the verison number in the script. A method does it automatically on start and gives a prompt to download the newest version. 
3. test.txt will be renamed when the real version comes out and will be where the puzzle lives on the github server.
